# Changelog

All notable changes to Claude HUD will be documented in this file.

## [0.0.2] - 2025-01-04

### Security
- Add CI workflow to build dist/ after merge - closes attack vector where malicious code could be injected via compiled output in PRs
- Remove dist/ from git tracking - PRs now contain source only, CI handles compilation

### Fixed
- Add 45k token autocompact buffer to context percentage calculation - now matches `/context` output accurately by accounting for Claude Code's reserved autocompact space
- Fix CI caching with package-lock.json
- Use Opus 4.5 for GitHub Actions code review

### Changed
- Setup command now auto-detects installed plugin version (no manual path updates needed)
- Setup prompts for optional GitHub star after successful configuration
- Remove husky pre-commit hook (CI now handles dist/ compilation)

### Dependencies
- Bump c8 from 9.1.0 to 10.1.3
